# Code of Conduct

In order to deliver great features and support to the Renovate Open Source project, we ask for high politeness and careful attention from those who want to participate.

## Our priorities

Our main goal is to keep this project sustainable.
This involves supporting our maintainers and contributors, most of whom volunteer their time to help others.
The biggest threat to Open Source projects is when maintainers get too stressed, and this stress is often caused by rudeness from a few users.

## Politeness

Sadly, it's not unusual in Open Source projects for a few users to be aggressive and disrespectful (like saying, "You should have fixed this already"), but we do not tolerate this behavior here.

We expect basic politeness—just don’t be rude.
It's fine if you ask a question and don’t thank us afterward.
However, avoid making disrespectful remarks like "Pity the documentation didn’t say that" or "thanks for nothing."

## Respect the time of those who help you

Respect is a two-way street, but time is limited, and those asking for help should remember that our maintainers’ time is precious.
We receive many queries each week and do our best to address each one.
Often, we need you to provide detailed logs or descriptions of your issues.
If you’re not prepared to do this, it’s unlikely you will get the help you need.

Remember, most of the support provided by our team, including Mend.io staff, is unpaid.

## Blocking and unblocking

We quickly tackle rudeness in the community through automated comments, temporary blocks, or permanent bans.
If you repeatedly break the rules (like spamming maintainers with @mentions) or challenge our guidelines openly, you will be blocked.
We generally do not argue about these decisions, but we are willing to reverse a block if a user shows they understand and respect the rules or if there was a misunderstanding.

Simply put, we block and unblock swiftly, and what matters is how you follow the rules going forward.

## How we prioritize work

For Renovate's core contributors and maintainers, we focus on work that:

- Benefits a large number of users, or
- Fixes regressions (errors introduced by recent changes), or
- Is required by a Mend.io customer,
- Is sponsored by 3rd parties after independent validation, or
- We personally need or want to implement

It may be disappointing when we can’t prioritize your specific feature or bug, but understanding and accepting this is crucial.

## Maintaining Issue and Code Quality

We use GitHub Discussions to start and sort issues but don't allow non-maintainers to directly create new issues.
If we confirm a bug or agree with a feature idea, and if it's well-documented, we will turn it into an official issue.
This process ensures that most issues are actionable, either by us or the community.

Sometimes we reject ideas if they are too specialized and would complicate the project more than they would help.

We enforce strict coding standards and reviews to keep our codebase maintainable.
A feature or fix must not only work, it must be well designed to stay maintainable.
We may ask for several revisions, which can be demanding, but our goal is to keep the project sustainable.

## If you have urgent work

People working for significant companies might push too hard in Open Source projects.
It’s often hard for them to understand that our maintainers cannot dedicate much time to solve their specific issues quickly.
Frequent requests for updates like "@rarkins how can we move this forward?" are not helpful.

Please remember, unless you are a Mend.io customer, this project does not owe you the level of response or support you might expect.
Mend.io customers should use their designated support channels for urgent needs.

## Getting more help

If you need more assistance than what this project offers, there are two options:

1. Become a Mend.io customer, such as by purchasing Renovate Enterprise, or
2. Hire an experienced Renovate contributor privately for consulting. Mend.io staff do not offer this service, but one of our volunteer maintainers, `@secustor`, does.

## Feedback

We welcome respectful discussions about this policy and accept suggestions for improving this text.
We avoid debates on social media or going off-topic in GitHub Discussions.

Our consistent delivery of new features and excellent community support show that our approach is effective.
